# Lessons learned — engineering gotchas

Generic, hard-won knowledge discovered while building this project: Unity/URP/HLSL/DOTS and the headless
test workflow. These are **engineering** gotchas — knowledge about the code and tooling, not process. Add
a lesson here when it (a) cost real debugging time, (b) is
not obvious from the code, and (c) will recur. Keep each entry tight and actionable.

## Shaders & HLSL

- **Editing a shared `.hlsl` CBUFFER/include can run STALE shader variants on the first headless batch
  run.** The GPU reads properties at the *old* CBUFFER offsets → garbage colors/lighting, while EditMode
  compiles clean. Tell-tale: a GPU-snapshot test fails in a way that's causally unrelated to your change
  (e.g. a normal-map effect goes to `diff=0` after a *color* edit). **Re-run `./Tools/run-tests.sh` once
  before treating a GPU-snapshot failure as a real regression** — a second clean batch run recompiles.
  Harder reset: delete `Library/ShaderCache`. (Seen: S58 `_MapColor` collapse — `BrgBackendSnapshotTests`
  + `LitFill_NormalMap` both failed on run 1, both passed on run 2.)

- **SRP Batcher requires the `UnityPerMaterial` CBUFFER to be byte-identical across every pass of a
  shader.** Define it once in a shared include (`MapLitInput.hlsl` / `MapLineInput.hlsl`); never add/remove
  members in per-pass code. Removing or adding a CBUFFER member shifts every later member's offset, and the
  change must be mirrored in **three** places that travel together: the CBUFFER, the
  `UNITY_DOTS_INSTANCING` block (+ sampled statics + `#define`s), and any BRG SoA packing
  (`BrgTileRenderer` `Pfx_*` offsets + `FloatsPerInstance` + `MetaCount`). Miss one → wrong-offset reads.

## Test workflow

- **Unity batch `-runTests` does not reliably generate/persist `.meta` for new or renamed files.** A new
  `.cs`/`.asmdef` may run once without a committed `.meta`. Force generation with a dedicated
  `-batchmode -quit` import, or delete+recreate the file. Never hand-author a `.meta`.
